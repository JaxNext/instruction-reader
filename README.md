# Instruction Reader

> People with advanced age or visual impairments often struggle to read text, especially when it comes to medicine instructions. To address this need, I plan to develop a web app that allows users to take photos of medicine instructions and then provides audio interactions. This way, users can understand the information by conversing with the app.
